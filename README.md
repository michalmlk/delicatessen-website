# Delicatessen website
## Remix practice project

In this project I'm trying to create family business delicatessen website with Remix which will be connected with headless CMS.

## Tech stack:
*   Remix with Typescript;
*   Styled components; 
*   DatoCMS;
*   GraphQL;
*   TailwindCSS.

I also used NextUI library.
Feel free to check current version (still in progress) on live:
